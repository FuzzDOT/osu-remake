<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my school AP Computer Science A Project, where I did a partial recreation of "osu!". I tried to recreate the entire game with all the features but ran out of time.

### Prerequisites

* some sort of ide
  ```sh
  ex. eclipse, (this project was made in intelliJ)
  ```

### Installation

1. Download the project from canvas
2. Unzip the file
3. Use the IDE of your choice to open the:
   ```sh
   build.gradle
   ```
   class as a gradle project
4. Once everything has imported, run the 'DesktopLauncher'
   ```sh
   desktop/src/com.osu.game/DesktopLauncher.java
   ```

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
1. Once you click play, you can use the left mouse button to click the buttons. The sliders you will have to click and hold the button, then drag it to the right, all the way to the end of the slider
2. Have Fun!


<!-- Problems I Faced -->
## Problems I Faced
1. The sliders, specifically how to code them. For Example, I was confused about if I should code the slider background separately or with the slider button.
2. The curveball of learning a new API. LibGDX has a very different way of handling rendering and such. So I had to watch a ton of tutorials as I worked my way through this project.
3. Canvas. It just wouldnt let me submit the zip file for some reason. It kept popping up an error that said, there is something wrong, please try again. 

<!-- Features I didn't implement -->
## Features I didn't implement
1. The circle that closes around the button, indicating the user when to click. I just was stuck with other problems and learning the API, so I didn't have enough time
2. The timing. I did try to implement it and somewhat succeeded but still wasn't what I wanted it to be. It broke my code whenever I tried to do it
3. The background image of the level. Just couldn't find the background image of the level

<!-- Short Reflection -->
## Short Reflection
Through the ups and downs and being upset at my code and computer, I did enjoy this project. Though it was a pain for me and this game was a really hard challenge, I somewhat succeeded, and I learned that no matter how much I didn't understand this new API, I do know how to code, specifically in java, and as the future becomes more reliant on coding, and as I am learning C# on my own, I am glad I took this course. Thank You Mr. Ellis for making it fun.
